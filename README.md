# nannou-sand-simulation

Learning [nannou](https://nannou.cc/), an open-source creative-coding toolkit for Rust, by implementing a visualization for a simulation of sand falling down in a cave (inspired by [Advent of Code year 2022 day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14)).

## Run the code

You will need a recent version of Rust installed.

- Clone this repo
- Run with `cargo run --release`
- ðŸš€ Enjoy!


## Generate an animation file

If you want to generate a video file (or a GIF) from the animation, go inside [`main.rs`](/src/main.rs) and uncomment the code related to generating images (inside `fn view`). Then run one of the following commands. You'll need `ffmpeg` installed in your system.

### Generate an mp4 video

```bash
cd frames
ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 60 -pattern_type sequence -i %06d.png -s:v 600x600 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p out.mp4
```

### Generate a GIF

```bash
cd frames
ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 60 -pattern_type sequence -i %06d.png -s:v 300x300 -loop 1 out.gif
```
